// # Given an object/dictionary with keys and values that consist of both strings and integers, design an algorithm to calculate and return the sum of all of the numeric values.
// # For example, given the following object/dictionary as input:
// # {
// #   "cat": "bob",
// #   "dog": 23,
// #   19: 18,
// #   90: "fish"
// # }
// # Your algorithm should return 41, the sum of the values 23 and 18.
// # You may use whatever programming language youâ€™d like.
// # Verbalize your thought process as much as possible before writing any code. Run through the UPER problem solving framework while going through your thought process.
